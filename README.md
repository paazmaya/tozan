Go trough files under the given directory, generate SHA-256 has out of their content, and store the hash to a SQLite database.
In case the given file was already listed in the database, its entry will be updated.

Please note that the minimum supported version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is `6.9.5`, which is [the Long Term Support (LTS) version](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS#lts-schedule1).

## Background for the name

The name of the project is for honouring the legacy of a certain master from the Ryukyu archipelago who contributed to the martial arts that we today know as **karate** and **ryukyu kobujutsu**.

## Installation

Install via `npm`, as a global command line utility:

```sh
[sudo] npm install --global tozan
```

The `sha256` hash is calculated with [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/), specifically with its [`openssl dgst`](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Manual:Dgst(1)) command, hence it needs to be available in the `PATH`.

## Command line options

Easiest way to see the supported options, is to execute with help output:

```sh
tozan --help
```

The most recent major version has the similar output to the following:

```sh
tozan [options] <directory>

  -h, --help              Help and usage instructions
  -V, --version           Version number
  -D, --database String   SQLite database to use - default: :memory:
  -i, --ignore-dot-files  Ignore files and directories that begin with a dot

Version 1.0.0
```

For more information on the possible database file options, [see `sqlite3` documentation for the `filename` parameter](https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3/wiki/API#new-sqlite3databasefilename-mode-callback).

## Contributing

Unit tests are written with [`tape`](https://github.com/substack/tape) and can be executed with `npm test`.
Code coverage is inspected with [`nyc`](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc) and
can be executed with `npm run coverage` after running `npm test`.
Please make sure it is over 90% at all times.

## Version history

* `v1.0.1` (2017-08-17)
  - Update `sqlite3` to version `3.1.9` which is the first to support Node.js v8
* `v1.0.0` (2017-06-28)
  - Drop `hasha` from dependencies and use [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) directly, but it needs to be in `PATH`
  - Safe guard against non existing files when getting meta information
  - Remove possible duplicates (due to symbolic linking) from the file list
  - Going to first major release as testing coverage is enough
* `v0.2.0` (2017-06-24)
  - Update database row if the file meta data was already stored
  - Show progress bar with percentage and file count
  - No more verbose command line option since the progress bar gives enough information
* `v0.1.1` (2017-06-24)
  - Was missing `README.md` from package and hence from [the npm page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tozan)
  - Now prints the file name when verbose, as advertised
* `v0.1.0` (2017-06-24)
  - Gets the job simply done, hence first release
